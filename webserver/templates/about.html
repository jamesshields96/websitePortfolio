                  <h3>Me</h3>
                  <p>Hi, I'm James and I am a 23 year old student at Monash University studying a Bachelors of
                    Information Technology, majoring in software development.
                    I am currently looking for any internships in software engineering field which can help supplement
                    my learning and help me grow as a person.

                  </p>
                  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                  <p>
                  <p><b>Snowboarding</b>
                    I have been snowboarding for 6 years now, mainly boarding at Mt Buller and Mt Hotham. I try and get
                    up to the mountains as much as possible but due to Australia's
                    small snow season and generally poor condidtions it can sometimes be hard to make it up. In 2019, I
                    was fortunate enough to travel to Japan for to snowboard for a week which
                    was an unforgettable experience.</p>

                  <p><b>Blacksmithing</b>
                    I started blacksmithing back in 2015 when i took a 4 week course up at Mont De Lancy blacksmithing
                    up in Wandin, Victoria. I have always been interested in blacksmithing ever since i
                    was a little kid watching fantasy movies like lord of the rings and playing many fantasy games like
                    world of warcraft. I find blacksmithing actually has a lot of paralles to software engineering
                    since the process requires a lot of problem solving.</p>

                  <p><b>Tinkering with Electronics</b>
                    Recently I have started messing around with Arduinos to help me, One.) become a better software
                    engineer and Two.) To teach myself about electronics and robotics. Currently I have built a
                    tempreture detecting
                    system that tells my the tempreture and humidity of my office. On top of mucking around with an
                    arduino, I also (attempt) to repair old game boy advances and game boy SP's. This process mostly
                    involves
                    cleaning up erosion on the circuit boards and replacing broken shells (the case containing the
                    electronics)</p>

                  <h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
                  <p> My main aspiration is to keep on learning. Rather than having a specific career as an end goal, I
                    am much more interested in ensuring that I can continue to learn and grow. I have many different
                    interest in the field, including
                    machine learning/A.I, computer architecture, game development and web development. I don't want to
                    ever get stagnant in a career and am always looking to improve myself and learn more. In my spare
                    time, I enjoy reseraching new topics
                    and undertaking a variety of projects to help me learn about new topics in the field of computer
                    science.
